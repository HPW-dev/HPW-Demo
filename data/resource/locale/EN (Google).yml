        You can record your gameplay to a file and launch it through
        "main menu" -> "replays". Only a replay can confirm
        the number of points scored by the player. The global leaderboard
        is located in the game files and on the project website.
      difficulty:
        easy: >
          Easy difficulty level - the player has a lot of lives.
          Enemies hit the player worse. You will not be able to complete the game
          and get the ending.
        normal: difficulty level at which the developer can complete the game himself
        hardcore: >
          Hard difficulty level - the player has few lives. The player's attacks are weaker.

        Motion interpolation makes the movement of objects smooth.
        If you disable this option, you will see objects there.,
        where they really are, but the objects will twitch or
        move abruptly. It also turns off motion blur.

      epilepsy: >
        Includes the most brutal graphic effects due to which
        it is impossible to distinguish anything on the screen. Better remember
        where is the graphics reset key...
      cpu_safe: Reduces CPU load. It may slow down the graphics
      blur_quality_mul: The lower the number, the smoother the blurring of moving objects and the higher the CPU load
      blink_particles: Flashes particles of smoke and debris after 1 frame, this allows you to speed up the graphics with lags
      disable_frame_limit: Turns off the frame limiter. The control will become more responsive, but the load on the processor will increase
      vsync: Makes the frame change smooth, but may cause lags when recording a game on video or broadcast
      frame_limit: Sets the maximum number of frames per second
      wait_frame: >
        The game will update the internal logic only after
        after completing the rendering of the frame, it makes the movements smoother
      fullscreen: Stretches the game window to the full screen
      show_mouse_cursour: Disables the display of the mouse cursor within the game window
      draw_border: Displays a white border around the game window
      double_buffering: Makes the frame change smoother

        one_to_one: Saves pixel sizes as multiples of an integer
      pressets:
        default: Adaptive - the game will simplify the graphics with lags for optimization
        low_pc: For weak PCs - turns off beautiful effects to make the game run faster
        high_quality: Beautiful effects can cause brakes
        high_quality_plus_stream: The same settings as in the "beautiful graphics", but optimized for recording the game from the screen.
      frame_skip: >
        the number of frames that will not be rendered so as not to waste

    count_buffers:
      title: Number of Audio Buffers
      desc: >
        A high number of audio buffers increases memory usage
        and eliminates sound interruptions. Three audio buffers are sufficient.
    size_buffers:
      title: Size of Audio Buffers
      desc: >
        A large audio buffer size increases memory usage
        and eliminates sound interruptions. 16 kilobytes is sufficient.
    count_sounds:
      title: Maximum Number of Sounds
      desc: >
        Limits the number of simultaneously playing sounds.
        If too few, not all sounds may be able to play.
